Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.emory.edu/) at Emory University. My research focuses on nationalism, political culture, and public opinion formation. 

My dissertation examines how nationalism permeates ostensibly nonpolitical realms like popular culture. Focusing on China’s entertainment sector, I study how the state co-opts stars to amplify nationalism and how ordinary people interpret these displays to draw boundaries of national belonging. On the production side, I analyze how celebrities’ nationalist displays are staged behind the scenes and the roles both the state and audiences play in shaping them. On the reception side, I explore how citizens in China interpret these nationalist cues—and, in doing so, how they exercise agency in draw symbolic boundaries of national belonging. I combine in-depth interviews, survey experiments, and ethnographic fieldwork in this work. My research has been funded by the [Halle Institute for Global Research and Learning](https://halle.emory.edu/students/graduateglobalresearchfellows.html) and the [OYCF-Chow Fellowship](https://oycf.net/bulletin). 

I received a B.A. degree in Sociology and Translation from the [University of Hong Kong](https://sociology.hku.hk/). I am a first-generation-to-college student.

In my free time, I love singing, journaling, chasing sunsets on hikes, and winding down with old movies or standup comedy. I’m also a voracious language learner, currently confusing my Duolingo owl with French, Korean, and the occasional Minionese. 

Feel free to contact me at lingxiao.chen \[at\] emory.edu.
