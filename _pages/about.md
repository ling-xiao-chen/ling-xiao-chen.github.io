Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.emory.edu/) at Emory University. My research focuses on nationalism, political culture, and public opinion formation. 

My dissertation examines how non-state actors shape cultural governance and political messaging in authoritarian contexts. Focusing on China’s entertainment industry, I analyze how the state co-opts celebrities to amplify nationalist narratives and how audiences interpret these displays to draw symbolic boundaries of national belonging. This project draws on mixed methods, including in-depth interviews, a national survey experiment, and archival research. My research has been funded by the [Halle Institute for Global Research and Learning](https://halle.emory.edu/students/graduateglobalresearchfellows.html), the [OYCF-Chow Fellowship](https://oycf.net/bulletin), and the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://www.theihs.org/funding-opportunities/humane-studies-fellowship/).

I received a B.A. degree in Sociology and Translation from the [University of Hong Kong](https://sociology.hku.hk/). I am a first-generation-to-college student.

Beyond academia, I enjoy singing, journaling, hiking, and winding down with old movies or standup comedy. I’m also a voracious language learner, currently confusing my Duolingo owl with French, Korean, and the occasional Minionese. 

Feel free to contact me at lingxiao.chen \[at\] emory.edu.
