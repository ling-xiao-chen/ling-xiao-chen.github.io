Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.emory.edu/) at Emory University, with broad interests in political and cultural sociology. My research focuses on nationalism, political culture, and public opinion formation. 

My dissertation examines how nationalism permeates ostensibly nonpolitical realms like popular culture. Focusing on China’s entertainment sector, I study how the state co-opts stars to amplify nationalism and how ordinary people interpret these displays to draw boundaries of national belonging. On the production side, I investigate how celebrities’ nationalist displays are curated behind the scenes, and what roles the state and audiences play. On the reception side, I explore how citizens in China interpret these cues—and, by extension, how they exercise agency in draw symbolic boundaries of national belonging. I combine in-depth interviews, survey experiments, and ethnographic fieldwork in this work. My research has been funded by the [Halle Institute for Global Research and Learning](https://halle.emory.edu/students/graduateglobalresearchfellows.html) and the [OYCF-Chow Fellowship](https://oycf.net/bulletin). 

I received a B.A. degree in Sociology and Translation from the [University of Hong Kong](https://sociology.hku.hk/). I am a first-generation-to-college student.

While I’m not doing research, I enjoy singing, journaling, hiking in search of the perfect sunset, and watching old movies and standup comedy. I’m also a voracious language learner, always jotting down phrases from new languages—from Korean to Minionese, keeping my Duolingo owl bemused.
