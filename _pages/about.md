I am Lingxiao Chen, a sociology PhD student at [Emory University](https://sociology.emory.edu/). I study nationalism, public opinion, and political culture in authoritarian contexts. I use a mixed-methods approach in my research, combining in-depth interviews with survey experiments. My current project examines how audiences engages with and interpret celebrity nationalism in China's entertainment industry. My research has been funded by the [Halle Institute for Global Research and Learning](https://halle.emory.edu/students/graduateglobalresearchfellows.html) and the [OYCF-Chow Fellowship](https://oycf.net/bulletin).
 
I received a B.A. degree in Sociology and Translation from the [University of Hong Kong](https://sociology.hku.hk/). I am a first-generation-to-college student.
