  How do ordinary people in authoritarian states interpret nationalist
  messages in everyday life? While research has shown how nationalism is
  reproduced through routine practices, less is known about how audiences
  interpret, adapt to, or resist official messages—and why. This study
  examines China’s entertainment industry, where the state co-opts
  celebrities to amplify nationalism and audiences interpret these
  performances to draw boundaries of national belonging. Using a national
  survey of Chinese citizens (N=2,211), I show that nationalism is a salient
  criterion in public evaluations of celebrity image. Drawing on 55 in-depth
  interviews, I develop a typology of audience orientations toward celebrity
  nationalism shaped by two key factors: individuals’ media repertoires and
  lived experience of exclusion from the national community. These
  orientations reveal that popular nationalism persists not only through
  internalized conviction but also by strategies such as pragmatic
  compliance, resignation, and subtle dissent. By highlighting how people’s
  routine engagement with celebrity culture normalizes nationalist cues in
  everyday life, the study explains how nationalism endures even when
  ideological commitment is weak. Grounded in the Chinese case, the
  findings advance debates on cultural governance, propaganda reception,
  and symbolic boundary-making in authoritarian contexts.
