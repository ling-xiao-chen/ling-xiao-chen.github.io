  How do citizens in authoritarian contexts interpret everyday nationalist messages? Existing research shows that nationalism is reproduced through routine practices, yet less is known about how audiences interpret, adapt to, or resist official messages—and why. This study examines China’s entertainment industry, where the state co-opts celebrities to amplify nationalist cues, and audiences interpret these performances to draw boundaries of national belonging. A national survey of internet users (N=2,211) indicates that nationalist norms carry high salience in public evaluations of celebrities, while revealing systematic heterogeneity across groups. Drawing on 55 in-depth interviews, I develop a typology of audience orientations shaped by two intersecting dimensions: individuals’ primary information repertoires and lived experience of exclusion from the national “we.” These orientations reveal that surface-level support for nationalist narratives can stem from divergent boundary-work logics, ranging from emotional compensation for marginalization to pragmatic compliance to subtle dissent. By highlighting how engagement with celebrity culture normalizes nationalist cues, the study argues that nationalism endures not only through internalized conviction but also as a taken-for-granted aspect of everyday life, even where its ideological pull is weak. Grounded in the Chinese case, the findings advance debates on cultural governance, propaganda reception, and symbolic boundary-making in authoritarian settings.
